# Session's Goals

* Understand how is made a general solution of a non-homogenous LODEs with cc. <br/><br/>
* Describe the function models and the relation with the non-homogenous term. <br/><br/>
* Describe the method of undetermined coefficients. <br/><br/>
* Apply the undetermined coefficients method to solve non-homogenous LODEs with cc. <br/><br/>

Content for **Session 04** is following [slides](/slides/2023-AD-MA1035-Eng/MA1035-sesion-04).
